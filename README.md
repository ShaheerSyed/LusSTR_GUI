# LusSTR GUI

This Streamlit application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the LusSTR tool, which is used to convert Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data of forensic STR loci to different sequence representations and allele designations for downstream analyses.

## Installation

Before running the GUI, you need to install the LusSTR package. You can find the installation instructions at [LusSTR GitHub page](https://github.com/bioforensics/lusSTR). Make sure to activate an environment with LusSTR installed.

## Running the GUI

Once you have installed LusSTR, you can run the GUI by executing the following command in your command terminal:

```
streamlit run lusstr_gui.py
```
